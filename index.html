                <p class="crochet-text">I started crocheting in 2020 because I wanted a new hobby and it just stuck with me. I have other hobbies that include fiber arts but crocheting is the one I do most often nowadays. There is something about it that makes it so satisfying. Maybe it is seeing the yarn become something truly usable or the problem solving that comes with figuring out sizing and shapes. It is a really fun hobby to keep my hands busy! I have made about 20 garments for myself and 8 for friends and family as gifts. I normally don't make stuff for people as it takes a lot of time and energy but sometimes I just want to show people I appreciate them with a tiny handmade gift.</p>

                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                <P>I actually do play video games! And a wide variety too. I love cozy games such as Stardew Valley and Strange Horticulture but I always enjoy more action packed/fantasy games such as Skyrim, Elden Ring, Don’t Starve, and The Last Of Us. I mainly play on PC now but when it is a game like The Last of Us or Elden Ring, I enjoy them a lot more on the Playstation 4.</P>

                <h2>Illustration and Reading</h2>
                <P>Illustration has been one of my favorite hobbies since I was a child. Doodling and sketching evolved into painting with gouache and acrylic paint. I love it because it allows me to be creative and create new worlds from just colors and lines. 
                Reading is also one of the hobbies I’ve had the longest. I used to read 1-2 books a week but that has definitely slowed down as my life has gotten busier and more stressful. I still try to read at least 1 book a month and it is a nice cozy hobby for me to enjoy.

                    <h2>Cardboard and Clay Sculpting</h2>
                    <P>A couple of years ago I decided to make a haunted dollhouse out of cardboard for Halloween. This led to me spending the entire month of October making it. I used cardboard, spackle, hot glue, foam, and so much more. It really gave me an appreciation of sculpture in general and inspired me to do sculpting with other mediums such as clay. I haven’t had the time to create many pieces but I do plan on adding to my Halloween Village so day!</P>
